# Data and Logs

Shamva keeps a detailed record of every check your monitor performs. This helps you understand your website's health over time and troubleshoot problems.

## What Data is Collected?
- The exact time each check was performed
- Whether your website was up or down
- The response time (how fast your website answered)
- The status code returned by your website (like 200 for OK, 500 for error)
- Any error messages or connection failures
- The region where the check was performed (if using multi-region monitoring)

## How Logs Work
- Every check result is saved as a log entry.
- Logs are stored securely and can be viewed in your dashboard.
- You can filter logs by monitor, time range, or status (up/down).

## Data Retention
- Shamva keeps your logs for a set period (for example, 15, 30, or 90 days, depending on your plan).
- After this period, old logs are deleted to save space and protect your privacy.

## Using Logs for Troubleshooting and Analytics
- Use logs to see exactly when problems started and stopped.
- Check response times to spot slowdowns before they become outages.
- Download or export logs for further analysis if needed.
- Use logs to create uptime reports or share information with your team.
