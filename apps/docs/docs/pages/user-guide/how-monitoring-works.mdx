# How Monitoring Works 🔍

Let's see how Shamva keeps an eye on your website!

## 1. The Monitor Sends a Message ✉️

Imagine your monitor is a little messenger. Every few minutes, it sends a message to your website: "Are you okay?"

## 2. The Website Replies 🗣️

If the website is working, it says: "Yes! I'm here!"

If the website is not working, it doesn't answer, or it says: "Oops, something's wrong!"

## 3. The Monitor Tells You 📢

- If everything is good, the monitor gives you a thumbs up! 👍
- If there's a problem, the monitor shouts: "Help! Your website needs you!" 🚨

## 4. You Can Fix Things Fast 🛠️

Because your monitor tells you right away, you can fix your website quickly, just like fixing a toy before your friends come over.
