# What is a Monitor?

A monitor is a tool that automatically checks your website or app to make sure it's working correctly. In Shamva, monitors help you know right away if something goes wrong, so you can fix it before your users notice.

## What Does a Monitor Do?
- It sends requests to your website or API at regular intervals (for example, every 1, 5, or 10 minutes).
- It checks if your website responds and if the response is correct (for example, HTTP 200 OK).
- It can check from different regions around the world to make sure your site is available everywhere.
- It records how long your website takes to respond (response time).
- If something is wrong (like your website is down or slow), the monitor creates an incident and notifies you.

## Types of Checks
- **HTTP Checks**: The monitor tries to load a web page or call an API endpoint.
- **Multi-Region Checks**: The monitor can check from different locations to detect regional issues.
- **Custom Checks**: You can add custom headers or request bodies for advanced monitoring.

## Why is Monitoring Important?
- It helps you find out about problems before your users do.
- It improves your website's reliability and builds trust with your users.
- It gives you data to understand how your website is performing over time.

Monitors are your first line of defense against downtime and help you keep your services running smoothly.
