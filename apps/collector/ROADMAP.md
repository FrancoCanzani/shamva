# Collector Roadmap to Production

## Phase 1: Core Stability (Week 1)
- [ ] Add unit tests for config parsing and validation
- [ ] Add integration tests for metrics collection
- [ ] Error handling improvements (network failures, timeouts)
- [ ] Add proper logging with levels (remove fmt.Printf)
- [ ] Memory leak detection and fixes
- [ ] Graceful shutdown improvements

## Phase 2: Production Features (Week 2)
- [ ] Configuration hot-reload without restart
- [ ] Health check endpoint for monitoring
- [ ] Metrics buffering during network outages
- [ ] Agent self-monitoring (memory usage, goroutines)
- [ ] Systemd service files and installation scripts
- [ ] Cross-platform builds (Linux, macOS, Windows)

## Phase 3: Security & Reliability (Week 3)
- [ ] TLS certificate validation
- [ ] Token rotation support
- [ ] Rate limiting for API requests
- [ ] Circuit breaker for failed endpoints
- [ ] Credential encryption at rest
- [ ] Process isolation and sandboxing

## Phase 4: Performance Optimization (Week 4)
- [ ] Optimize metrics collection performance
- [ ] Reduce memory footprint
- [ ] Batch metrics sending
- [ ] Compress request payloads
- [ ] Connection pooling improvements
- [ ] CPU usage profiling and optimization

## Phase 5: Monitoring & Observability (Week 5)
- [ ] Structured JSON logging
- [ ] Metrics about the collector itself
- [ ] Integration with common log aggregators
- [ ] Performance dashboards
- [ ] Alert integration for collector failures
- [ ] Automatic crash recovery

## Phase 6: Enterprise Features (Week 6)
- [ ] Multi-tenant support
- [ ] Custom metrics plugins
- [ ] Configuration management API
- [ ] Centralized configuration distribution
- [ ] Audit logging
- [ ] RBAC for agent management

## Critical Bugs to Fix Now
- [ ] Fix battery detection on non-laptop systems
- [ ] Handle missing temperature sensors gracefully  
- [ ] Prevent goroutine leaks in HTTP client
- [ ] Add timeout to all system calls
- [ ] Fix disk space calculation on multi-mount systems

## Infrastructure Requirements
- [ ] Automated testing pipeline
- [ ] Release automation
- [ ] Binary signing for security
- [ ] Package repositories (APT, RPM, Homebrew)
- [ ] Documentation site
- [ ] Performance benchmarking suite

## Success Criteria
- Zero memory leaks under load
- Sub-1% CPU usage on production systems
- 99.9% uptime
- Handle 1000+ agents per endpoint
- Deploy in under 2 minutes
- Recovery from any single failure
