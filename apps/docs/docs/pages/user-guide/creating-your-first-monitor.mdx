# Creating Your First Monitor

Setting up a monitor in Shamva helps you keep track of your website or app. Here's a step-by-step guide to creating your first monitor, with explanations for each setting.

## Step 1: Log In
Go to Shamva and log in with your account. If you don't have one, sign up or ask your workspace admin to invite you.

## Step 2: Create a Workspace
A workspace is a group for your monitors. Click "New Workspace" and give it a name (for example, "My Project" or "Team Website").

## Step 3: Add a Monitor
Find the button that says "Add Monitor" or "New Monitor." Click it to open the monitor form.

## Step 4: Fill Out the Monitor Form
- **Monitor Name**: Give your monitor a name you'll recognize (like "Main Website" or "API Health").
- **URL to Monitor**: Enter the full web address you want to check (for example, `https://mywebsite.com`). Make sure it's correctâ€”typos will cause errors.
- **Method**: Choose how Shamva should check your site. "GET" is most common for websites. Use "POST" or "HEAD" for special cases.
- **Check Interval**: How often should Shamva check your site? Choose a time (like every 1, 5, or 10 minutes). More frequent checks give faster alerts but use more resources.
- **Monitoring Regions**: Select where you want checks to come from. You can pick one or more regions. More regions help detect regional outages.
- **Headers (optional)**: Add custom HTTP headers if your site needs them (for example, for authentication). Enter them as a JSON object.
- **Request Body (optional)**: For POST requests, add a JSON body if needed.
- **Slack Webhook URL (optional)**: Paste your Slack webhook URL here if you want to receive notifications in Slack. (See the Notifications and Alerts guide for how to get this URL.)

## Step 5: Save and Start Monitoring
Click "Save" or "Create." Your monitor will start checking your website right away.

## Troubleshooting Tips
- Double-check the URL for typos or missing `https://`.
- If you use custom headers or a request body, make sure they are valid JSON.
- If you don't receive notifications, check your email address or Slack webhook URL.
- If your monitor shows errors, check your website's firewall or access controls.

If you need more help, ask your workspace admin or check the other guides in this documentation.

**Method**: This tells Shamva what kind of request to make to your website. You can choose:
  - **GET**: The most common method. GET asks your website for a page or data, just like a regular visitor. Use this for most websites and APIs.
  - **POST**: Sends data to your website, often used for forms or APIs that create or update something. Only use POST if you know your endpoint expects it (for example, submitting a form or triggering an action).
  - **HEAD**: Like GET, but only asks for the headers (not the full page). Useful for checking if a page exists without downloading the whole thing.

**Examples:**
- Use **GET** for `https://mywebsite.com` or `https://api.example.com/data`.
- Use **POST** for `https://api.example.com/submit` if you need to send data (and fill out the Request Body field).
- Use **HEAD** if you just want to check if a file or page is available.

**Check Interval**: This controls how often Shamva checks your site. Options usually include every 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, or 60 minutes.
- **Short intervals (1-5 minutes)**: You'll get alerts faster if something goes wrong, but it uses more monitoring resources and could increase costs or rate limits on your site.
- **Longer intervals (10-60 minutes)**: Fewer checks, less resource usage, but slower to alert you if there's a problem.

**Recommendations:**
- For critical sites (e.g., production websites, APIs): Use 1-5 minutes.
- For less important or staging sites: Use 10-30 minutes.
- For personal or low-traffic sites: 15-60 minutes is usually enough.

If you're not sure, start with 5 minutes. You can always adjust later based on your needs and plan limits.
