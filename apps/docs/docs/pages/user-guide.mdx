# User Guide

Welcome to **Shamva** – professional uptime monitoring with global edge deployment, intelligent health checks, and beautiful status pages.

## What is Shamva?
Shamva is a tool that helps you make sure your websites and online services are always working. It checks your sites from around the world and lets you know if there's a problem, so you can fix it fast.

## Key Features (Explained Simply)
- **Global Edge Monitoring:** Shamva checks your website from different countries. This means you'll know if your site is down for everyone or just in one place.
- **Intelligent Health Checks:** Shamva doesn't just check if your site is up – it also looks for slowdowns or other issues. If something's wrong, it tries to check again before alerting you, so you don't get too many messages.
- **Status Pages:** You can create a public page that shows if your site is working. Share this with your users so they always know what's going on.
- **Workspace Collaboration:** Work with your team. You can invite others, give them different roles (like admin or viewer), and manage everything together.
- **Comprehensive Analytics:** See charts and reports about your site's uptime, how fast it loads, and any problems that happened.

## Getting Started (Step by Step)
1. **Sign Up/Login:** Go to the Shamva website and create an account or log in.
2. **Create a Workspace:** This is like a folder for your projects or teams.
3. **Add a Monitor:** Enter your website or API address. Choose how often you want Shamva to check it, and from which regions.
4. **Set Up Alerts:** Add your email or Slack so you get notified if something goes wrong.
5. **View Status Pages:** Share your public status page with your users.

## Using the Dashboard (What You'll See)
- **Monitors:** See a list of all the sites you're checking. Add, edit, or remove them. View charts showing uptime and speed.
- **Incidents:** If your site goes down, Shamva creates an incident. Track what happened and when it was fixed.
- **Logs:** Look at detailed records of every check Shamva does.
- **Status Pages:** Customize and share your public status pages.
- **Workspaces:** Manage your team members and what they can do.

## Example: Monitoring a Website
1. Add your website (e.g., `https://mywebsite.com`).
2. Choose to check it every 1 minute from the US, Europe, and Asia.
3. If your site goes down in Europe, you'll get an alert, and your status page will show the issue.
4. When it's fixed, Shamva updates your status page automatically.
