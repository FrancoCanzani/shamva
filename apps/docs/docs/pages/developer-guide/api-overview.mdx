# API Overview

The Shamva API lets you interact with monitors, workspaces, status pages, and more. Here's how it works:

## Structure

- All API routes start with `/api/` (e.g., `/api/monitors`)
- RESTful: Use `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` for actions

## Authentication

- Most routes require an `Authorization` header with your token
- Example: `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN`

## Example Request

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" https://your-shamva-instance.com/api/monitors
```

## Main Endpoints

- `/api/monitors` – Manage monitors
- `/api/workspaces` – Manage workspaces
- `/api/status-pages` – Manage status pages
- `/api/incidents` – View and update incidents

See the codebase for more details or try the endpoints with a tool like Postman!
