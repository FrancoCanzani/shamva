# Notifications and Alerts

When something happens to your website, Shamva lets you know right away so you can fix it quickly.

## How Do You Get Notified?
- **Email**: Shamva can send you an email if your website goes down or comes back up. All accepted users in your workspace will receive these emails automatically.
- **Slack**: You can receive a message in your team's Slack channel if you set up a Slack webhook.

## What Kinds of Alerts?
- Down Alert: Your website is not working.
- Recovery Alert: Your website is back online.

## How to Set Up Email Alerts
You don't need to do anything special. If you are a member of the workspace, you will get email notifications automatically.

5. Search for "Incoming Webhooks" and add it to your workspace.
6. Click "Add New Webhook to Channel."
7. Choose your channel and click "Allow."
8. Copy the Webhook URL that Slack gives you. It will look like: `https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXX/YYYY/ZZZZ`

### Step-by-Step: Adding the Webhook to Shamva
1. Go to your monitor's settings in Shamva.
2. Find the field labeled "Slack Webhook URL."
