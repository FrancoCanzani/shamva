# Monorepo Structure

The Shamva monorepo is organized for scalability and collaboration. Here's an overview of the main directories:

```text
shamva/
  apps/
    docs/      # Documentation site (vocs)
    web/       # Main web app (React + Vite + Hono)
  package.json # Root dependencies and scripts
  README.md    # Project overview
  tsconfig.json# TypeScript config
```

## Directory Explanations

- **apps/web**: The main application. Contains frontend (React) and backend (Hono API) code.
- **apps/docs**: The documentation site, built with vocs.
- **package.json**: Manages dependencies for the whole monorepo.
- **tsconfig.json**: TypeScript configuration shared across apps.

## How Apps Interact

- The **web** app exposes both a frontend and an API (via Hono) on Cloudflare Workers.
- The **docs** app is a static site for user and developer documentation.
- Shared code and types can be added to a `packages/` directory if needed for future growth.
