# Incidents and Downtime

Sometimes, your website or app might stop working. In Shamva, these problems are called **incidents**.

## What is an Incident?

An incident is a record of a time when your website was not working as expected. Shamva creates an incident when it detects repeated failures from your monitor.

## How Does Shamva Detect Downtime?

- The monitor checks your website at regular intervals (for example, every 1 or 5 minutes).
- If a check fails (the website does not respond or returns an error), Shamva tries again a few times to make sure it's not just a temporary problem.
- If the website keeps failing for several checks in a row (the threshold), Shamva creates an incident.

## What Happens When an Incident is Created?

- Shamva records the time, the error, and other details about the problem.
- You receive a notification (by email and/or Slack, if set up).
- The incident appears in your dashboard, where you can see all current and past incidents.

## Viewing and Resolving Incidents

- Go to the "Incidents" section in your dashboard to see a list of incidents.
- Click on an incident to see more details, such as when it started, what error was detected, and which monitor found the problem.
- When your website is working again, Shamva will automatically mark the incident as resolved.
- You can also add notes or acknowledge the incident to keep track of what actions were taken.

Incidents help you keep track of problems and make sure nothing is missed. Use them to understand what went wrong and how to fix it faster next time.
